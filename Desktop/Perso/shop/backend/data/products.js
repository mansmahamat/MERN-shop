      'As an indoor plant, its needs are simple. It manages in almost any light conditions, needs infrequent watering and generally just gets on with things. It will appreciate a feed with liquid fertiliser once per month in spring and summer. This is an ideal beginner’s plant that gives impressive results with very little work from you. In the wild, they can reach up to 80-metres tall, so there’s a growing challenge for you.',

      "This impressive tree has a thick trunk and dramatic leaves. Slow growing and very easy going, it's the perfect addition to any low maintenance jungle. In the wild, this yucca is found in Mexico or Central America, giving it the ‘guatemalensis’ part of its name. When fully grown, it can be as tall as six metres. This yucca is easy to grow as a houseplant, just remember that it’s used to hot, dry conditions. Do everything you can to remind it of its sunny home by giving it as much light as possible and being sparing with water.",

      "In the wild, this plant grows on hot, coastal parts of Africa and Mexico. It likes to bask in full sun, so when growing it at home keep it somewhere that enjoys lots of natural light and doesn’t get too cold. It’s a fast grower, so may need repotting about every three years. It will also benefit from a feed with a liquid fertiliser once per month in spring and summer. It's a big plant that needs food to grow.",

      'As a houseplant it won’t become a tree, or grow flowers and fruit (we don’t have the necessary conditions). It will remain a tall, handsome plant that deals very well with living inside. When caring for it, think desert: Lots and lots of light; not a lot of water. ',

      'A small cactus is a great starter plant or gift because it’s so easy to care for. It will tolerate lower light conditions, but thrives in sun, and needs very little water. Cacti would much much rather be too dry than too wet. Try to make yours think its in the desert.',

      'Like most citrus plants, it loves lots of sun, so put it in your brightest spot. It likes its soil to be kept moist, which may mean watering its soil every couple of days at the height of summer. In colder months it may only need watering every couple of weeks. Leaves will provide fragrance year round, with flowers appearing in spring and summer. Fruit will follow, taking up to six months to ripen. Feeding at least once a month will encourage fruiting. ',

      'The beautiful fatsia japonica gets its name from the Japanese word ‘fatsi’, meaning ‘eight’, because its magnificent leaves have eight lobes. It’s found in the wild in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, where it lives happily through warm summers and pretty cold winters (it can cope with temperatures as low as −15 °C).',

      'In the wild, it grows mainly in southwestern Europe, in places like Spain and Portugal, but also in North Africa. It’s quite a slow grower, but in the wild it can reach heights of up to 5m, with its fan-like leaves growing as long as 1.5m. It won’t reach those heights in a pot and will only grow a few centimetres per year, so don’t worry about it taking over your balcony or patio.',
