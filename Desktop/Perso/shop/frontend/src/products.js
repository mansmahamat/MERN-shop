      'It grows in tropical areas all over the world, including Central America, the east side of Africa and parts of Australia. As an indoor plant, it’s very slow growing and relatively easy to look after. It likes its soil quite dry and the air humid. You can boost its growing a bit by giving it a feed once in spring and again in summer. It doesn’t like to be fussed about too much, so it’s good for areas where it won’t be brushed against a lot. It’s been around millions of years; it needs a bit of time to itself.',

      "This impressive tree has a thick trunk and dramatic leaves. Slow growing and very easy going, it's the perfect addition to any low maintenance jungle. In the wild, this yucca is found in Mexico or Central America, giving it the ‘guatemalensis’ part of its name. When fully grown, it can be as tall as six metres. This yucca is easy to grow as a houseplant, just remember that it’s used to hot, dry conditions. Do everything you can to remind it of its sunny home by giving it as much light as possible and being sparing with water.",

    description:
      'It’s a native of South-East Asia, where it grows in tropical forests. As a houseplant, it’s quite easygoing. It likes a fairly bright spot and regular watering (it doesn’t like to dry out), but that’s about it. It’s not that fussed about humidity, so a mist every week or so should be enough. Unlike the fiddle leaf fig, it’s not especially sensitive to being moved or changes in temperature.  If it’s ever unhappy it will let you know by dropping leaves. Lots of leaves falling are usually a sign of too little light or improper watering. Adjust those and it should quickly get back on track. ',
